# Work Day Scheduler
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap, Moment.JS

## How it works
Enter your daily tasks into the text boxes! Then based on the current time (displayed at the top for your convenience), It will either gray out (old task), Red(Current Hour), or turn green(Future tasks). And just remember to press the save icon on the right in order to store your tasks locally.

## Troubles Along The Way
I found myself repeating my own code severaly times during this project. I should try and focus more on the DRY concept and think of ways to automate certain features. This is one of my first projects with bootstrap, so it took me a little while to figure out how to make certain media query adjustments. Overall it was not too difficult of an application. I would like to go back and see if I can remove some of the repeat code in the future
